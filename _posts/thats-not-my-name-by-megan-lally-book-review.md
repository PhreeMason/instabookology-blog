## A Shiver-Inducing Start
From the very beginning, I was hooked. The story starts with a young woman waking up bruised and battered on the side of a road, her memory wiped clean. The tension escalates when a man claiming to be her father appears, complete with her ID and family photos. The burning question I had was whether she could trust this man, and whether she was truly the person he claimed she was. 


## A Tangled Web of Lies and Memory
The narrative cleverly alternates between the perspectives of the amnesiac girl and a boy named Drew, who is accused of a crime he's adamant he didn't commit. This structure kept me eagerly flipping pages, trying to piece together the puzzle just as the characters were, doubting every fact and supposed memory. 


## A Debut That Packs a Punch
Lally's characters are a masterpiece of complexity, revealing their layers and raw emotions as the story unfolds. Her skillful use of suspense and strategic details had me constantly guessing, pushing me to look deeper than what was immediately apparent. 


## The Verdict
In my opinion, *That's Not My Name* is a thrilling ride that delivers on its promise of an adrenaline rush. I couldn't put it down and ended up finishing it in just one day. Lally has certainly set a high standard with this book, and if you're into young adult thrillers that perfectly balance tension and emotional depth, you definitely shouldn't miss this one.

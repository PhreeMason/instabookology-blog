📍 Thriller - Domestic, Psychological  
📍 Family Secrets  
📍 Small Town  
📍 Flashbacks  
📍 Dysfunctional Family  

## The Strengths
The author excels at crafting page-turners and capturing complex family dynamics. The novel shines in its exploration of sibling bonds – the love, resentment, and rivalry that often coexist.

## The Weaknesses
Some characters veer into stereotypes, and the final reveal didn't quite deliver on the build-up. The archetypes of the golden boy, problem child, and caregiver felt familiar.

## The Verdict
An entertaining yet flawed domestic thriller. The author's talent for suspense and juicy family drama kept me invested. A quick, nostalgic read with soapy twists – but don't expect groundbreaking revelations.

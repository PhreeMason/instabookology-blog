## The World and Characters Shine
Scheuerer's world-building remains top-notch, expanding Thezmarr's realms with the same magic and mystery that captivated me initially. Thea and Wilder's development continues to be a strong point, offering depth and relatability that keep the pages turning.

## Romance Overload and a Predictable Finale
However, the sequel introduces numerous steamy scenes that feel more distracting than integral to the plot, lacking the buildup necessary to feel meaningful. A lot of it was happening at inopportune times—during crucial battles and urgent missions. I mean... I do enjoy some spice, but aren’t there more pertinent things? Additionally, the ending was a bit too predictable.

## Final Thoughts
Despite its flaws, *Vows & Ruins* still offers a compelling journey through Thezmarr. For fans of the series, it's a worthy read.  I'm looking forward to the release of the next book, *Fate & Furies*, on February 22nd.

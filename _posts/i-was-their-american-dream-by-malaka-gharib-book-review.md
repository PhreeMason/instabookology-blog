## A Tale of Two Cultures
Gharib, the daughter of an Egyptian father and a Filipino mother, takes us on a journey through her childhood and adolescence, navigating the complexities of her multicultural heritage. She paints a vivid picture of her life, filled with confusion, joy, and the constant struggle to fit in.

The book is a delightful mix of comic strips, family photos, and personal anecdotes that make you feel like you're flipping through a family album.


## Characters That Resonate
Gharib's depiction of her family struck a chord with me. Her parents, with their high expectations and traditional values, were sources of both frustration and inspiration. The friends, classmates, and teachers in her life provided a colorful backdrop to her self-discovery.

But it was Gharib herself who truly captivated me. Her honesty, humor, and vulnerability were so compelling that I found myself cheering for her, laughing with her, and at times, wishing I could offer her a comforting hug.


## Themes of Identity and Belonging
At its core, *I Was Their American Dream* is about the search for identity and a sense of belonging. Gharib explores what it means to be American, to be an immigrant, and to be a child of two cultures. She grapples with questions of race, class, and privilege, and the ways in which they intersect and shape our lives.

The memoir didn't avoid the difficult truths of the immigrant experience‚Äîthe outsider feeling, the pressure to assimilate, and the longing for a homeland that feels increasingly distant. Yet, it also celebrated the richness and diversity of this experience, and the unique perspective it provides.


## A Must-Read for Our Times
*I Was Their American Dream* is a thought-provoking look at what it means to be part of America's great melting pot. It's a book that made me laugh, think, and perhaps see the world a little differently.

So, if you're in search of a book that's personal, a bit different, and filled with heart, I'd recommend giving *I Was Their American Dream* a chance. You might just find echoes of your own story within its pages.

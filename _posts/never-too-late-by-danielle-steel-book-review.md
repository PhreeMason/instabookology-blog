## The Premise: A Widow's New Chapter
*Never Too Late* introduces us to Kezia Cooper Hobson, a recently widowed woman who decides it's time to turn the page and start a new chapter in her life. Moving from San Francisco to New York, Kezia is determined to embrace change and rediscover herself. And, as fate would have it, her new apartment comes with a movie-star neighbor, Sam Stewart. Just when Kezia thinks she's settling in, a devastating crisis strikes New York City, bringing her and Sam closer together. Sounds like the perfect setup, right?

## Characters: Depth or Déjà Vu?
Kezia is relatable, resilient, and ready to face whatever life throws at her. But here's the thing – while Kezia's journey is inspiring, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I've met her before in other Steel novels. The same goes for Sam Stewart, the charming yet somewhat predictable love interest. Don't get me wrong, they're enjoyable to read about, but I found myself craving a bit more complexity and unpredictability from our leads.

## The Plot: Comforting, Yet Predictable
If you're in the mood for surprises and twists at every turn, you might find *Never Too Late* a tad predictable. That's not to say it's not enjoyable; there's something undeniably comforting about knowing you're in for a feel-good story. But for those seeking a rollercoaster of emotions, this might not hit the mark.

## Themes: A Mixed Bag
*Never Too Late* tackles quite a few complex themes: loss, change, the importance of human connection, and the courage to embrace new beginnings. The novel shines in moments where these themes are brought to the forefront, particularly in the context of volunteering and community service following a crisis in New York City.

## The Writing Style: Classic Steel
Danielle Steel's writing style is like a cozy, well-worn sweater: familiar, comfortable, and easy to sink into. Her prose is straightforward, making *Never Too Late* an easy read.

## The Verdict: Worth the Read?
So, is *Never Too Late* worth adding to your TBR pile? If you're a die-hard Danielle Steel fan, absolutely. It has all the hallmarks of her storytelling – romance, drama, and a dash of luxury. For those looking for a light read that offers a touch of inspiration, you'll likely enjoy this journey. However, if you're in the mood for something with a bit more depth and unpredictability, you might find this novel a tad too familiar.

In the end, I'm giving *Never Too Late* a solid three stars. It's a pleasant read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon or as a companion on a long flight. While it may not break new ground, it serves as a reminder that it's indeed never too late to seek out new beginnings. And really, isn't that a message we can all get behind?

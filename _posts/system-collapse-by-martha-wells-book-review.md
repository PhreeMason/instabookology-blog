## The Good Stuff
The writing is sharp and the story is well-paced. Murderbot's interactions with its human companions provide plenty of entertaining moments. Wells does a great job of making an AI construct feel like a fully fleshed-out character.

## The Drawbacks
*System Collapse* feels repetitive at times. The plot is fairly predictable, lacking the freshness of earlier installments. Characterization also feels a tad stagnant - Murderbot and its human friends don't seem to evolve much from previous books.

## The Verdict
As a Murderbot fan, I was hoping for a bit more from this latest outing. *System Collapse* is still a solid, entertaining read that series fans will appreciate. However, it doesn't quite reach the heights of standout entries like *Rogue Protocol*. I’m hoping Murderbot's next adventure packs more of a punch.

## The Contents
The book explores how Childhood Emotional Neglect (CEN) - a lack of emotional support from parents - can lead to struggles with self-discipline, emptiness, and nurturing relationships. Through relatable examples, Dr. Webb helps readers identify signs of CEN and understand its impact. However, more concrete strategies to overcome CEN would have made this resource even more impactful as the book is severely lacking them.

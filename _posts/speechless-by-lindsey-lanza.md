## A Fresh Start in Malibu
Imagine this: you're bestselling author Lucy Gold, fairy tales are your bread and butter, but your own happily ever after? Not so much. After a sudden divorce shatters her dreams on the eve of her thirtieth birthday, Lucy, along with her loyal service dog, decides it's time for a change. Destination? The sunny shores of Los Angeles for a fresh start. But as fate would have it, her plans hit a snag right before takeoff. Enter Henry Turner, a handsome stranger with a heart of gold and a house full of eccentric musicians in Malibu. Sounds like the beginning of a fairy tale, right?

## The Sweet Symphony of Healing
*Speechless* isn't just a love story; it's about overcoming your deepest insecurities and choosing happiness, no matter what life throws at you. Lucy's journey is one of self-discovery, healing, and learning to love again after loss. And Henry? Well, he's at the peak of his creative career but struggling with crippling anxiety that throws his personal life out of tune. It's a fantastic contemporary romance that doesn't shy away from tackling heavy topics like chronic illness and mental health, all while maintaining a light-hearted and hopeful tone.

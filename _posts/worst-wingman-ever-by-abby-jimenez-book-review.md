## A Charming Meet-Cute
Holly, our protagonist, finds an unexpected Valentine's Day card on her windshield during a tough time in her life. This kicks off a series of sweet exchanges between Holly and the mystery man behind the notes.

## It's Not Just About the Love Story
*Worst Wingman Ever* is a romance, but it's also about healing, family, and learning to open your heart again after it's been broken. 

I also loved Holly's relationship with her grandma. It's the kind of bond that'll make you want to call up your own grandparents and tell them how much you love them.

Abby Jimenez has created an endearing story that'll make you fall in love with its characters and the power of a well-placed note. If you're looking for a quick read with a happily ever after, this is the story for you. It's the perfect escape from the daily grind for anyone who enjoys a good romance with a side of feels.

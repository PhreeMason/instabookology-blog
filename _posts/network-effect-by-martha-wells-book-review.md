## Murderbot's Journey
Murderbot's relatable struggle to understand newfound emotions and friendships was both heartwarming and painfully human. I loved exploring the evolving relationships between Murderbot and the humans and AIs it interacted with.

## A Rich Universe
The story expanded the vividly realized universe with fascinating new planets, factions, and tech that felt plausible. Questions about AI consciousness and rights added depth to the story.

## Witty Writing and Thematic Depth
I love how Wells combines fast-paced action and humor with deeper themes. As Murderbot interacts with humans and bots, it explores questions of identity and personhood that add substance to this entertaining read.

## Engaging Characters
The side characters, like the innocent bot Miki and Murderbot's human teammates, are well-developed. They help Murderbot grow emotionally as it deals with its biases and navigates tricky human-AI relationships.

## Great for Murderbot Fans
*Rogue Protocol* is a crowd-pleaser for Murderbot fans that moves its story forward in fulfilling ways. New readers should start with book one, *All Systems Red*, and get ready to adore this unforgettable hero. If you like clever, meaningful sci-fi with a lovable lead, check out this series.

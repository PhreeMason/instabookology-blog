The story is tightly written, with every word contributing to building tension and developing characters. The worldbuilding provides hints of a much larger universe waiting to be explored.

My only complaint is that the story ended too quickly, but I suppose that's to be expected from a prequel - it's a teaser of the greatness to come.

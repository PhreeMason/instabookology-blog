## Unforgettable Characters
From the flawed but inspiring Darrow to the deliciously evil Jackal, the characters in Morning Star were well-developed and memorable. I was invested in their struggles and motivations, which drove the story forward.

## A Vivid, Crumbling World
The world-building was excellent, transporting me from icy moons to opulent halls. The color-based societal structure was a key part of the narrative, not just a backdrop. I felt fully immersed in this vivid, crumbling world. 

## Themes of Power, Love, and Sacrifice
*Morning Star* explored themes of oppression, freedom, love, and sacrifice in a way that resonated with me. It didn't shy away from the darker aspects of rebellion, adding depth and emotional impact to the story.

## Final Verdict
*Morning Star* is a must-read for fans of the series and anyone who enjoys a thrilling, action-packed story with heart. If you haven't read the *Red Rising Saga* yet, I highly recommend starting now! This series has become one of my all-time favorites.

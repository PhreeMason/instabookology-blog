## The Plot and Themes
When Murderbot's human clients are in danger on a distant planet, it's up to our snarky robotic hero to protect them and unravel the mystery. Wells keeps the pacing tight and the suspense high throughout the book.

*All Systems Red* explores themes of autonomy, identity, and what it means to be human. 

## Final Thoughts
The novella is an engaging and charming sci-fi read. I’m excited to continue the series.

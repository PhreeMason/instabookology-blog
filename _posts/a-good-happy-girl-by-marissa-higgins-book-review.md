## Characters With Depth, But Uneven Development
Helen is well-drawn as someone barely holding it together, prone to self-destructive behavior as she tries to escape her family issues. Catherine and Katrina, the couple Helen gets involved with, are also vividly portrayed. However, as the story progressed, I found myself wishing for more growth and development from them.

## A Plot That Meanders
The pacing and plot is where my interest started to wane the further I read. After a strong start, the story began to meander and lose focus in the middle.

## Final Thoughts
The characters are memorable, but the story ultimately failed to keep me fully engaged. However, it's still a nice first novel that showcases Higgins' skills with character, theme, and language.

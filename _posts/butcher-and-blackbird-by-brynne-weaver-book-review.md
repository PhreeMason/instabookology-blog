## A Game of Cat and Mouse
The plot of *Butcher & Blackbird* is a game of cat and mouse, as Sloane and Rowan engage in an annual competition to see who can take down the most dangerous killers.

The first half of the story felt like a collection of filler information, with little to no real conflict driving the story forward. It was a series of events strung together, but without a clear sense of direction or purpose. As a reader, I found myself waiting for the plot to kick in and the real meat of the story to begin.

## The Art of Banter
One thing I absolutely adored about *Butcher & Blackbird* was the banter. The conversations were flirtatious, fun, and a masterclass in how to keep a romantic interest engaged. It was like watching a tennis match of wit and charm, and I was thoroughly entertained.

## The Story Heats Up in the Final Quarter
It wasn't until the last 25% of the book that the story finally found its footing and became much more engaging. The conflict that had been missing in the first half of the novel finally reared its head, and I found myself invested in the characters and their struggles. I only wish this level of engagement had been present throughout the entire book.

## Love in the Time of Murder
At its core, *Butcher & Blackbird* is a love story, albeit an unconventional one. Watching Sloane and Rowan navigate their feelings for each other while also grappling with the weight of their dark deeds is fascinating.

## Final Thoughts
If you're looking for a book that will make you laugh, make you cringe, and make you feel things you never thought you would, *Butcher & Blackbird* is the book for you.

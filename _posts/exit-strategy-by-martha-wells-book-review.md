## Murderbot on a Mission
When Murderbot sets out on a high-stakes rescue mission, the action is non-stop and the emotions run deep. I was on the edge of my seat as this cyborg struggled with newfound feelings and its role in the universe. Saving its friend forces Murderbot to admit it truly cares.

## Snarky and Heartfelt
Wells weaves hilarious snark with touching character growth. I laughed out loud at Murderbot's witty remarks, then found myself moved by its increasing fondness for the humans it protects. Seeing a lethal android discover its humanity is simply wonderful.

## A Satisfying Conclusion (For Now)
*Exit Strategy* wraps up the major plot threads from the first four novellas and sets the stage for new adventures in the full-length novel *Network Effect.* Murderbot's journey of self-discovery feels far from over.

## The Verdict
In the end, *Exit Strategy* is a win, with its blend of action, humor, and heart. Wells has birthed an iconic character in Murderbot that I won't soon forget. I recommend this novella to any sci-fi fan looking for a fun, surprisingly relatable read.

## A Series of Cases
The team faces a myriad of cases over the course of the book, solving a series of seemingly impossible crimes which expose the dark underbelly of the city. From a kidnapping to an art theft to a body dump site, the cases they tackle are as varied as they are intriguing.

## Final Thoughts
*Holmes, Marple, & Poe* is a novel that starts off strong but loses some of its momentum in the second half. The second half of the book could have benefited from a tighter narrative and a more focused approach to the cases. Reading through the book felt like watching a detective-themed sitcom on TV. The characters are flawed and interesting, the cases are intriguing, and the writing style is engaging.

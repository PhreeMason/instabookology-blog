## A Fantasy World with a Dash of Romance

*Fourth Wing* is set in a fantasy world where the country of Navarre is protected by an elite army of dragon riders. The story follows twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail, who was supposed to live a quiet life among books and history in the Scribe Quadrant but finds herself thrust into the world of the dragon riders. As she navigates this new and dangerous world, she forms unexpected alliances and discovers dark secrets that threaten everything she holds dear.

Violet Sorrengail is a character who defies the odds. Despite her small stature and brittle body, she's determined to become a dragon rider, a feat that many believe is impossible for someone like her. But Violet is not one to back down from a challenge. Her journey is a testament to her strength and determination, and it's impossible not to root for her.

Violet's relationships with other characters, particularly Dain and Xaden, add depth to the story. Dain, her childhood best friend, cares for her but doesn't seem to fully understand her. Xaden, on the other hand, is the dangerous, fiercely attractive son of an executed rebel leader. I guess every romance needs a love triangle but this one felt imbalanced. From my point of view, Xaden felt like the only option from the moment she laid eyes on him.


## A Rollercoaster of Emotions

This book has received somewhat mixed reviews. Some readers have praised it for its thrilling and adventurous feel, while others have criticized it for its predictable plot and familiar fantasy tropes. Personally, I found myself torn between these two perspectives. On the one hand, I couldn't put the book down, thanks to Yarros' easy-to-devour writing style and the abundance of action scenes. On the other hand, I couldn't help but notice that the story treads familiar ground, and some of the characters felt a bit too much like stock fantasy archetypes. The romance parts dragged on too long, bringing me out of the immersion.


## Final Verdict

In the end, *Fourth Wing* is a book that will likely appeal to fans of fantasy romance and dragon-filled adventures. If you're looking for a fast-paced read with occasional steamy scenes, this might just be the book for you. However, if you're seeking a completely original and groundbreaking piece of fantasy fiction, you might find yourself wishing for more. As for me, I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next book in the series. I definitely see the appeal of diving back into the world of Navarre and its daring dragon riders.

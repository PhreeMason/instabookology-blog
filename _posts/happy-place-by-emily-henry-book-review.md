## The Perfect Couple... Or Not?
Our main characters, Harriet and Wyn, remind me of my favorite comfort food‚Äîfamiliar, heartwarming, and a touch bittersweet. They've been the ideal couple since their college days, but now, they're more like two mismatched socks. They ended their relationship five months ago, yet here they are, sharing a bedroom at their annual friends' retreat in a Maine cottage, pretending they're still together.

## The Setting: A Cottage of Memories
Imagine a quaint cottage in Maine, a yearly retreat that's a slice of heaven for Harriet, Wyn, and their friends. It's a place steeped in tradition, where the air is salty with secrets and the shores echo with laughter. But this year, the cottage is also a stage for Harriet and Wyn's performance of a lifetime.

## The Heart of the Matter: Growth and Second Chances
*Happy Place* isn't just a rom-com; it's a deep dive into the complexities of love and friendship. It's about the pain of growth, the awkward dance into adulthood, and the lessons learned along the way.

## The Style: Witty Banter and Tender Moments
Henry's writing is a cocktail of humor and poignancy, with dialogue that snaps like fresh celery. It's true, some readers might find the banter a tad overdone, like a cake that's too rich. But for those who savor sharp wit and heartfelt exchanges, <i>Happy Place</i> delivers a feast for the senses.

## The Verdict: A Cozy Read with Depth
While *Happy Place* might have its moments of frustration‚Äîmiscommunications that make you want to shake the characters‚Äîit's a testament to Henry's skill that we stay invested in their journey. It's a story that reminds us it's never too late to find your happy place, even if it means starting over. 

So, if you're in the mood for a romance that's as comforting as a warm blanket on a cold day, with a side of self-discovery and growth, *Happy Place* might just be your next read. Just remember, like a beach vacation, it's about the experience, not just the destination.

## The Seven Tools for Life
In his book, Schwarzenegger shares seven life tools that he used to attain success in every aspect of his life. He presents each tool with practical advice and insights, making them relatable and applicable to me and, I believe, to anyone from any walk of life.


## A Relatable and Engaging Read
Despite his stern and disciplined persona, Schwarzenegger's writing style made me feel like he was a friendly mentor with a good sense of humor. His knack for infusing humor and light-heartedness into his writing added a delightful charm.

## Conclusion
*Be Useful* is more than just a self-help book to me. It's a memoir that blends elements of self-help and motivational literature, making it a versatile and engaging read. Although it became a bit verbose at times, Schwarzenegger's storytelling skills allowed me to connect with his personal experiences. His practical advice gave me a chance to learn from his journey of self-improvement. *Be Useful* has inspired me to actively seek personal growth, surround myself with positive influences, and contribute to others. It reminded me that with the right mindset and tools, even the most wildest dreams can turn into reality.
